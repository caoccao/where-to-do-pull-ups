# Where to do Pull-ups?

This project is a guide to free bars for pull-ups in cities around the world.

While traveling around the world, we often want to find a place to do pull-ups. However, finding a free pull-up spot can be a difficult task. Sometimes we would have to book a hotel with the gym, or even have to join a gym to do the pull-ups.

Why not share the free spots around our cities? Let's make it easier for everyone to find a place to do pull-ups by contributing to this project.

## Cities

- [China - Shanghai](china/shanghai/README.md)
- [China - Shenzhen](china/shenzhen/README.md)

## Contribute

Take photos (max width 800px) of free pull-up spots in your city, mark them on google map and add them to the respective city folder via pull requests.

If you find the guide out of date, pull requests are welcome correcting it.
