# Where to do Pull-ups?

This project is a guide to free bars for pull-ups in cities around the world.

While traveling around the world, we often want to find a place to do pull-ups. However, finding a free pull-up spot can be a difficult task. Sometimes we would have to book a hotel with the gym, or even have to join a gym to do the pull-ups.

Why not share the free spots around our cities? Let's make it easier for everyone to find a place to do pull-ups by contributing to this project.

## Cities

- [China](china)
  - [Shanghai](china/shanghai/README.md)
  - [Shenzhen](china/shenzhen/README.md)
- [Germany](germany)
  - [Berlin](germany/berlin/README.md)

## Contribute

Take photos (max width 800px) of free pull-up spots in your city, mark them on google map and add them to the respective city folder via pull requests.

If you find the guide out of date, pull requests are welcome correcting it.

## Why do Software Engineers Need to do Pull-ups?

Software engineers tend to have back and neck problems:

- **Lower Back Pain**: Prolonged sitting in a chair, often with poor posture, can lead to lower back pain and stiffness.   
- **Neck Pain**: Staring at a computer screen for long periods can cause neck strain and pain, especially if the monitor is not positioned correctly. This is sometimes referred to as "tech neck".   
- **Rounded Shoulders and Forward Head Posture**: These postural issues can develop due to prolonged sitting and can lead to muscle imbalances, pain, and reduced mobility.

Pull-ups are a fantastic exercise with a wide range of benefits for software engineers' physical health and fitness. Here's a breakdown of some key advantages:

### Strengthens Upper Body and Core Muscles

- **Back**: Pull-ups are excellent for developing your back muscles, particularly the latissimus dorsi (lats), which are responsible for the "V" shape. They also engage other back muscles like the rhomboids and trapezius.   
- **Arms**: Your biceps and forearms get a significant workout during pull-ups, contributing to overall arm strength and definition.   
- **Shoulders**: Pull-ups activate shoulder muscles, especially the deltoids, which help stabilize your shoulders during the exercise.   
- **Core**: To maintain stability and control during the movement, your core muscles, including your abs and obliques, are engaged.

### Improves Grip Strength

- Holding onto the bar and lifting your body weight requires a strong grip. Regular pull-ups will significantly improve your grip strength, which has benefits for other exercises, sports, and daily activities.

### Enhances Functional Fitness

- Pull-ups mimic movements used in everyday activities like lifting objects, climbing, and even carrying groceries. By strengthening the muscles involved in these movements, pull-ups improve your overall functional fitness.

### Improves Posture

- Strengthening your back muscles helps to counteract the effects of prolonged sitting and can improve your posture by pulling your shoulders back and promoting a more upright position.

### Boosts Metabolism and Helps Burn Fat

- Pull-ups are a compound exercise that engages multiple muscle groups, leading to a higher calorie burn compared to isolation exercises. Building muscle mass through pull-ups also increases your resting metabolic rate, meaning you burn more calories even when at rest.

### Improves Bone Health

- Pull-ups are a weight-bearing exercise that places stress on your bones, which can help increase bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.

### Convenient and Effective

- Pull-ups require minimal equipment – just a bar. This makes them a convenient exercise that can be done at home, at the gym, or even in a park.
